        Hi, I'm Dan Crotty, and welcome to my page! As a former college coach,
        3x All-American, and 2021 MAC Conference Defensive Player of the Year,
        I'm excited to offer private, individual, and small group lacrosse
        lessons for boys and girls of all skill levels and ages in the Charlotte
        area. I am a proud alum of Stevens Institute of Technology, where I
        honed my skills as a defenseman in field lacrosse. I also played as a
        forward in box lacrosse, giving me a deep understanding of what it takes
        to be elite on both sides of the ball.
        <br />
        <br />
        While coaching in college, I oversaw both the face-off units and goalie
        units, gaining immense knowledge of the specialty positions and how to
        train them. I train all positions and ages, and my goal is not just to
        teach the "how" but also the "why." My depth of knowledge allows each
        lesson to be specifically tailored to the areas the athlete needs to
        work on to reach their goals.
